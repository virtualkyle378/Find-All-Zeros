Find-All-Zeros
==============

Using a polynomial equation entered, this program will output them in simplest rational form.

This program is a port of the FindAllZeros portion of the Rational-Equation-Solver program to TI-BASIC.

It is compiled with http://sourceforge.net/projects/tibasic/ for use on my TI-84 calculator.

I added indentions for code creation but it cannot be compiled this way.
